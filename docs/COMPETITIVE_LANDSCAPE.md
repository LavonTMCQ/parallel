# Competitive Landscape: The "Walled Gardens" vs. Parallel

## Executive Summary
The P2P resale market is dominated by "Walled Gardens" that rely on high fees (13-20%) and manual listing friction to retain users. Parallel disrupts this by acting as a "Liquidity Mirror," using client-side automation to bridge inventory and leverage fee arbitrage.

## 1. Poshmark (The Social Giant)
*   **Model:** Social Commerce. High friction (sharing parties), high fees (20% flat).
*   **Weakness:** The "20% Tax" is hated by power sellers. The "Social" aspect requires hours of manual labor daily.
*   **Parallel Advantage:** 
    *   **Fee:** 10% vs 20%.
    *   **Automation:** "Set and Forget" vs "Share every hour".
    *   **Strategy:** We target their Power Sellers who are tired of losing 20% margin.

## 2. eBay (The Source)
*   **Model:** The Everything Store. Massive supply, clunky 1990s backend, complex fee structure (13.25% + $0.30 + Promoted Listings).
*   **Weakness:** User Experience is hostile. Sellers treat it as a necessary evil.
*   **Parallel Advantage:** 
    *   **UI:** Modern, "Apple-like" dashboard.
    *   **Ingestion:** We don't compete with eBay for supply; we *clone* it. We treat eBay as our warehouse.
    *   **Safety:** Our JIT check prevents double-selling, solving the biggest risk of multi-platform selling.

## 3. Depop (The Gen Z Favorite)
*   **Model:** Instagram for thrifting. 10% fee + Transaction fees.
*   **Weakness:** Extremely manual. No bulk tools.
*   **Parallel Advantage:** 
    *   **Speed:** Our Chrome Extension imports 100 items in the time it takes to list 1 on Depop.
    *   **Cross-Pollination:** We bring eBay inventory (older generation) to a Gen Z aesthetic interface.

## The Structural Moat: "Sync & Slash"
Incumbents cannot copy us because **they cannot encourage users to list elsewhere**. 
*   If Poshmark built an "eBay Importer," they would admit eBay has better supply.
*   If eBay built a "Price Slasher," they would lose their 13% revenue stream.

We are platform-agnostic. That is our moat.
